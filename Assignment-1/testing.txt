During a visit to the Cleveland Indians, Beane meets Peter Brand, a young Yale economics
graduate with radical ideas about how to assess player value. Beane tests Brand's theory by
asking whether he would have drafted Beane out of high school. Though scouts considered
Beane hugely promising, his career in the Major Leagues was disappointing. Brand admits that,
based on his method of assessing player value, he would not have drafted him until the ninth
round. Impressed, Beane hires Brand as his assistant manager.
